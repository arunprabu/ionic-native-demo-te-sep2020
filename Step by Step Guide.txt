create a new project
    ionic start ionic-native-app --capacitor

    select the tab based project. 

    cd ionic-native-demo 

Then, initialize capacitor in this project
    npx cap init 

        Note: you will find the following in the command prompt 
        Add platforms using "npx cap add":

        npx cap add android
        npx cap add ios
        npx cap add electron

        Follow the Developer Workflow guide to get building:
        https://capacitorjs.com/docs/basics/workflow


Then, exec 
    ionic build

Then, add the android platform to the project 
    npx cap add android

Then, open the project in vs code 

    ionic serve

Let's first implement camera and photo taking app.
    Refer tab2.html and ts 

    And after writing all the lines of code you will get an error in console when you click the photo icon.
    Refer the link: https://capacitorjs.com/docs/pwa-elements
    Then exec,
    npm install @ionic/pwa-elements

    Then, in main.ts,
    write the following lines before environment related if condition.

    import { defineCustomElements } from '@ionic/pwa-elements/loader';
    // Call the element loader after the platform has been bootstrapped
    defineCustomElements(window);


====
Now test the app in android studio emulator (after code change - try the following)
    exec the following commands
        ionic build  // web assets 'www' folder would be created.
        npx cap sync    // synchronizes ionic and native app -- copies  web assets 'www' folder to android public assets 
        npx cap open android
        
Then setup SDK for android studio and download emulator 
and then run the app after switching on emulator
